# Molecular Data

This repository contains molecular datasets for machine learning experiments. Each dataset is organized into folders named after the corresponding molecule.

## Contents

Each folder represents a molecule and includes the following files:

- `*_train.xyz`: A trajectory file for training the machine learning potential.
- `*_test.xyz`: A trajectory file for testing the machine learning potential.
- `*_i.xyz`: An initial structure to start simulations.

### Example

The `aspirin` folder contains:

- `aspirin_train.xyz`: Training trajectory file.
- `aspirin_test.xyz`: Testing trajectory file.
- `aspirin_i.xyz`: Initial structure file for simulations.
